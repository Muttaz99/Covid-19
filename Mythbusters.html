            <h4 class="alert alert-dark">FACT: Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot cure COVID-19</h4>
            <p>Micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.
                WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.</p>
            <h4 class="alert alert-dark">FACT: Studies show hydroxychloroquine does not have clinical benefits in treating COVID-19</h4>
            <p>Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a treatment for malaria, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis, has been under study as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among hospitalised COVID-19 patients, nor help people with moderate disease.*
                The use of hydoxychloroquine and chloroquine is accepted as generally safe for patients with malaria and autoimmune diseases, but its use where not indicated and without medical supervision can cause serious side effects and should be avoided.
                * More decisive research is needed to assess its value in patients with mild disease or as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.</p>
            <h4 class="alert alert-dark">FACT: People should NOT wear masks while exercising</h4>
            <p>People should NOT wear masks when exercising, as masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably.
                Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms. The important preventive measure during exercise is to maintain physical distance of at least one meter from others.</p>
            <h4 class="alert alert-dark">FACT: The likelihood of shoes spreading COVID-19 is very low</h4>
            <p>The likelihood of COVID-19 being spread on shoes and infecting individuals is very low. As a precautionary measure, particularly in homes where infants and small children crawl or play on floors, consider leaving your shoes at the entrance of your home. This will help prevent contact with dirt or any waste  that could be carried on the soles of shoes.</p>
            <h4 class="alert alert-dark">FACT: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus, NOT by bacteria</h4>
            <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is in a family of viruses called Coronaviridae. Antibiotics do not work against viruses.
                Some people who become ill with COVID-19 can also develop a bacterial infection as a complication. In this case, antibiotics may be recommended by a health care provider.
                There is currently no licensed medication to cure COVID-19. If you have symptoms, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for assistance.</p>
            <h4 class="alert alert-dark">FACT: The prolonged use of medical masks* when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency</h4>
                The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally. Do not re-use a disposable mask and always change it as soon as it gets damp.
                * Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are flat or pleated; they are affixed to the head with straps or have ear loops.      <p></p>
            <h4 class="alert alert-dark">FACT: Most people who get COVID-19 recover from it</h4>
            <p>Most people who get COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms and can recover thanks to supportive care. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early - call your health facility by telephone first. If you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue seek medical care immediately.</p>
